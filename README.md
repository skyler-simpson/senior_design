### Project Abstract
Create an AI-powered minigame where users describe a character in natural language, and AI models generate both the character’s attributes and sprite for an interactive minigame.

## Project Description
Our project is an AI-powered sprite generation system, combining machine learning with interactive gameplay. Users will type in a short description (e.g., “a fast ninja with fire powers”), and our system will use natural language processing to translate the description into attributes for sprite generation and game development. A corresponding 2D sprite will then be generated, and it will be playable in a simple mini-game. We plan to incorporate machine learning at multiple stages, including text-to-attribute mapping, sprite or ability generation.
