### Meeting w/ Professor Norouzi
- in the NLP, the only thing that would be useful is you take an open source language model and give it some Q/A and tell it to give answers when it gets certain questions
    - Not really fine tuning
- with larger models 
- with image generation (ideogram), it's mainly working with APIs
    - creating a prompt for some image generation models is an art itself
    - the second part of the project is more API-engineering. Not much to learn that'll help you (other than image generation)
- Prof recommends putting more effort into the first part of the project 
    - Rather than game, generate a short video from it
- 2 people work on NLP, 2 people work on character to animation/video generation
    - output of group 1 is input of group 2
    - NLP
    - Video generation (not many open source models)


### TODO
- Write up our goal and block diagram breaking down the flow of the project
- Create a timeline (ideally done by Februrary)
    - realisitically you have 4 months
    - Finish as much as you can this semester and wrap it up
- Meet every 2 weeks. 45 minutes
    - 8:30a - 9:15a

### Post meeting 
- Game > video since that'll be a bit more unique
- 3 parts:
    1. NLP
    2. Sprite generation
    3. Game development
