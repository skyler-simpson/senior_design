### Tentative Project Descriptions

#### TLDR:
    Our project is an AI-powered character design system that translates natural language prompts (e.g., “a fast ninja with fire powers”) into playable 2D game characters using NLP. This character is then playable in a simple mini-game. We plan to use machine learning at several stages, such as text-to-attribute mapping and sprite/ability generation.

#### Longer version:
Our project is an AI-Powered Game Character System that combines machine learning with interactive gameplay. Users will type in a short description (e.g., “a fast ninja with fire powers”), and our system will use natural language processing to translate the description into structured character attributes such as speed, strength, and abilities. A corresponding 2D sprite will then be generated, either by selecting and modifying assets from a pre-made library or through generative models when the sprite is not available in the library. The character is then playable in a simple mini-game where visitors can immediately interact with the creation. To emphasize the AI/ML focus, we plan to incorporate machine learning at multiple stages, including text-to-attribute mapping, sprite or ability generation, automated balancing, and playstyle clustering. The result will be a fun, demo-ready system that highlights both the fundamentals of ML and its creative application in a gameplay scenario. 

### What is our purpose/intention with the project?
The project is a way for us to focus on learning NLP (and general ML). Also the generative character development and minigame allows people to interact with the project at the CEAS Expo.

---
- Do we want to use our own platform for the game or use a prexisting one?
    - Start off with just one minigame that all characters would play, but if there's time, users can generate their own game

- We are unsure on feasibility and technical details of the project. We are looking for him to lead us in the right direction and we can research and implement the project.

3 areas of focus:
- NLP model
    - Breaking down each prompt into attributes
    - Attributes:
        - attack
        - attack range
        - defense
        - speed
- 2nd model 
    - to generate sprites
- Game development
    - Have it as its own application
    - Not a web app
