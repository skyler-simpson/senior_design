# VATS Task Lists for NLP Based Game Generator Program  

## Research and Setup  

- Research game engine technologies and frameworks that will work best for this application for the minigame - Skyler & Thomas 

- Research NLP model/frameworks (Hugging Face,etc) - Soham  

- Research sprite generation models that will fit the needs of our application. - Ary 

## Game Development  

- Develop main test level for users to demo their gameplay. - Thomas 

- Develop navigation so the user can jump and move around in the game. - Skyler 

- Develop the game logic for the character attacks. - Skyler 

- Utilize the given sprite animation for moving and attacking. - Thomas 

- Utilize the character stats that are given by the NLP model. - Skyler 

## NLP + User Input Parsing Development  

- Define a user input format standard for character descriptions for user. - Soham & Ary 

- Test the accuracy and efficiency of different NLP models in converting user-input descriptions to sprite attributes. - Soham 

- Build and test baseline NLP model pipeline (description -> attributes/abilities/physical characteristic) - Soham  

- Fine-tune NLP model for better processing to handle more ambigious inputs and consistent ouputs – Soham  

## Sprite Generation  

- Utilize the physical characteristics from the NLP model to generate a sprite. - Ary 

- Develop the logic to generate the sprite as per the user’s description. - Ary 

- Investigate whether we need to train or fine-tune a sprite generation model or if an API is necessary for our project. - Ary 

- Explore options for multi-sprite generation, so users can select between multiple sprites(Stretch Goal) - Ary 

## Integration and Control  

- Design control program to autonomously handle interaction between the user, generation models, and game. - Thomas 

- Integrate NLP + Sprite + Stats/Attributes into a user-friendly and demoable pipeline/application - Team  

- Test end-to-end pipeline performance and bugfix/ensure good user experience – Team.
