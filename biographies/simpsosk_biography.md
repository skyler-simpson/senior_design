### Desired Project
I would like to work on a project that incorporates AI/ML into an everyday task. My work experience has all been in development; however, I have and am taking a lot of the data analysis electives offered at UC and would like to put into practice what I have learned. I recognize that AI/ML will become even more common in our everyday lives than it already is, and I would like to become familiar with the process of building a model and incorporating it into a preexisting system or one of my own.
