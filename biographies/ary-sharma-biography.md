## Project Sought
With limited experience in machine learning, I am seeking a capstone project that allows me to learn about ML. I have never worked with computer vision, for example, so exploring how ML applies in that context would be particularly interesting. My main priority is to learn something new through my capstone project, regardless of the specific domain.
